<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Using Node.js, Express, Html/CSS, and Boostrap I created a static web application that captured all requirments for my CS350 final project.

Project Constraints:
* Create slide show of most recent summer vacation
* Create Summer Schedule and include all current courses
* Embed favorite audio and visual files. ( I don't want to loose your love tonight - The Outfield, David Goggin's Motivational Life Story (Video))
* Create basic JS game. (Created Shape game, due to time constraints couldn't add restart button functionality)
* Create User form with basic client side validation. 


In conclusion I am excited to start my journey into Software Engineering and already can see the value in using languages like react which allow for easy component re-usage. Future plans involve learning the MERN Stack, as well as other back end tools like Sanity.

### Conclusion

As this repo contains photos of myself, and isn't practical for someone to use as a starting point for web development I will not be giving instructions on how to set-up and run this website. As a novice Web developer I know there is a lot of improvment that can be done from this app, and look forward to updating once I aquire new skills! 

Update: After completion of project, and graduating with B.S. in Computer Science May 2022 I have rebuilt my portfolio website with React, and Sanity which is visually stunning in comparison to this project. However this is apart of my journey and will leave this repo to catalog just how far I've come! Cheers, and happy programming!
