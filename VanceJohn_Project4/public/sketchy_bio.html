        <p>
            Hello my name is <strong>John Vance</strong>, and I am currently enrolled as a senior at <em>Southern Illionis University in Carbondale, IL</em>. I am orginally from Dallas, Texas but have lived in Boston MA, Fayetville AR, and Springfield MO. My favorite activites to do range from playing Ultimate frisbee to gaming all night on LOL. Also I have a puppy named posie, and she is a golden doodle who consumes the majority of my free time!

            <p>
                Although I have lived in several states throughout my life I would have to say my favorite place to live was Dallas, Tx. Now I may be a little bias since I was born there, as well as went to highschool in Dallas where I played the sport I love the most which is football! One of my favorite sayings was that you can take the boy out of Texas but you can't take the Texas out of the boy!

        <h2>Sketchy Motto</h2>
        <p>
            From since I could remeber my mother would always say this quote to me, and I always try to use it in my everyday life to stay authentic to me and not deviate from my desired course!<hr>
            <q cite="https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/reference/frequently-asked-questions/quotes-faq-2/">This is the lesson: never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense.</q><hr> Although I try I can admit that not always am able to follow this motto for life, but as human beings it is important to grow and not set strong defintions on every point of view as often times a different perspective can bring a completly different outlook on the matter at hand.
